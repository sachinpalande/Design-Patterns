- Abstract factory is like factory of factories.
"lets you produce families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes."

- When to use : If the product is made of many sub-product and those sub-product can be increased in future.

- Solution: 1. Create all Sub-product classes and implement them
            2. Create Factory/Creator abstract class and have make functions for sub-products.
            3. Implement the make function in child classes of factory.

- Examples: 1. Furniture makes "Chair & Sofa" of type "Modern & Victorian" --> if have to add another furniture like "Table" or type as "Italian" it will be easy.
            2. Theme for Editor "Black & White" for "Background and Text"
